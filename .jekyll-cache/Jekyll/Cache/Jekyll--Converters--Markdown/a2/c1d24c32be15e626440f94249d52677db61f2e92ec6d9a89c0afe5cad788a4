<p><em>My name is <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ru Ke√Øn</code>. Some words about me:</em></p>

<p>Entrepreneur-turned-Data-Scientist focused on solving the most important technical challenges in science. I love spending my days coding algorithms, building computers, composing music, and writing stories. As both artist and scientist, my favorite place to be is at the edge of uncertainty, navigating the unknown. Also, I just really love rockets, black holes, telescopes, robots, and computers.</p>
