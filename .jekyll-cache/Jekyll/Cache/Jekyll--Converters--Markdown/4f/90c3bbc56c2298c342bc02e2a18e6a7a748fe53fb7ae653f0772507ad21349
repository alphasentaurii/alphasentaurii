<h2 id="business-case">Business Case</h2>

<p>Recommend top 5 zipcodes for client interested in buying a single-family home in Westchester County, NY within the next two years.</p>

<h2 id="required-parameters-from-client">Required Parameters (from Client)</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Timeframe: Purchase of new home would take place within the next two years</li>
  <li>Budget: Cost to buy not to exceed <code class="highlighter-rouge">800,000 USD</code> maximum</li>
  <li>Location: Zip Code search radius restricted to Westchester County, New York</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="ideal-parameters-from-client">Ideal Parameters (from Client)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Commute: Towns/Villages having shortest/fastest commute New York City</li>
  <li>School District: Zip codes include towns with A/A+ school district rating</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="success-criteria-for-model">Success Criteria for Model</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Maximum ROI (highest forecasted home value increase for lowest upfront cost)</li>
  <li>Confidence Intervals</li>
  <li>Risk mitigation: financial stability of homeowners and homes based on historic data</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>

<p>Make forecast predictions for zip codes and their mean home values using Seasonal ARIMA time-series analysis.</p>

<h2 id="commute-times">Commute Times</h2>

<p>Since commute time to Grand Central Station is part of the client‚Äôs required criteria, I first had to look up which towns/zip codes were on which train lines. Grand Central has 3 main lines on Metro North Railroad: Hudson, Harlem, and New Haven. The first question I was interested in answering was if the average home prices for the zip codes that fall under these geographic sections display any trends.</p>

<h2 id="future-work">FUTURE WORK</h2>

<p>My client was keen on accounting for public school districts, which upon initial inspection would have required a great deal of manual plug and play. However, if there is an API or some other way to scrape this data from the web, I would definitely incorporate school districts as an exogenous factor for the sake of making recommendations for a client. Someone might actually <em>not</em> prefer schools with a rating of 10 as these tend to be predominantly all-white. My client in particular was looking for decent school districts below the 10-mark because she wants her child to grow up in a more ethnically-diverse community. Being able to account for such preferences would be part of the future work of this project.</p>
