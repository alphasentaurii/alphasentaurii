<h1 id="project-outline">Project Outline</h1>
<p>Prior to training, I set out to identify trends, seasonality, and autoregression elements within the Zillow Housing Market Dataset. I then use a fitting procedure to find the coefficients of a regression model, including several plots and statistical tests of the residual errors along the way. The top 5 zip code recommendations rely on the following factors: highest ROI, lowest confidence intervals (lowest risk), and shortest commute time from Grand Central Station.</p>

<h2 id="business-case">Business Case</h2>

<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>

<p>Recommend top 5 zipcodes for client interested in buying a single-family home in Westchester County, NY within the next two years.</p>

<p><strong>Required Parameters (CLIENT)</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Timeframe: Purchase of new home would take place within the next two years</li>
  <li>Budget: Cost to buy not to exceed <code class="highlighter-rouge">800,000 USD</code> maximum</li>
  <li>Location: Zip Code search radius restricted to Westchester County, New York</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Ideal Parameters (CLIENT)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Commute: Towns/Villages having shortest/fastest commute New York City</li>
  <li>School District: Zip codes include towns with A/A+ school district rating</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Success Criteria for Model</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Maximum ROI (highest forecasted home value increase for lowest upfront cost)</li>
  <li>Confidence Intervals</li>
  <li>Exogenous factors (requires external data)</li>
  <li>Risk mitigation: financial stability of homeowners and homes based on historic data</li>
</ol>

<p>Make forecast predictions for zip codes and their mean home values using Seasonal ARIMA time-series analysis.</p>

<h2 id="model">Model</h2>

<p>Make forecast predictions for zip codes and their mean home values using Seasonal ARIMA time-series analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Model Identification</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Plots and summary statistics</li>
  <li>Identify trends, seasonality, and autoregression elements</li>
  <li>Get an idea of the amount of differencing and size of lag that will be required.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Parameter Estimation</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Use a fitting procedure to find the coefficients of the regression model.</li>
  <li>split data into train and test sets.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Model Checking</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Plots and statistical tests of the residual errors</li>
  <li>Determine the amount and type of temporal structure not captured by the model.</li>
</ul>

<p>The process is repeated until a desirable level of fit is achieved on the in-sample or out-of-sample observations (e.g. training or test datasets).</p>

<p><strong>Forecasting</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Input complete time-series and get prediction values</li>
  <li>Identify top 5 zip codes based on required criteria (above).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mean-values-by-train-line">Mean Values by Train Line</h2>

<p>Since commute time to Grand Central Station is part of the clientâ€™s required criteria, I first had to look up which towns/zip codes were on which train lines. Grand Central has 3 main lines on Metro North Railroad: Hudson, Harlem, and New Haven. The first question I was interested in answering was if the average home prices for the zip codes that fall under these geographic sections display any trends.</p>

<h3 id="new-haven-line">New Haven line</h3>

<p>Note that this does not include zip codes in Connecticut (which the New Haven line covers) since the client is only interested in towns in New York state.</p>

<h2 id="gridsearchcv-with-sarimax">GridsearchCV with SARIMAX</h2>

<p>I then ran a gridsearch using a Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMAX) model to make forecast predictions on all 66 zip codes in Westchester County.</p>

<p>Using PANDAS, I narrowed down the list by top 10 highest ROI zip codes. I then identified which of these had the lowest confidence intervals in order to ensure I was only selecting the most accurate results.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/timeseries/conf_roi_heatmap.png" width="400" /></p>

<p>The top five I selected based on the above criteria were 10549, 10573, 10604, 10605, 10706:</p>
