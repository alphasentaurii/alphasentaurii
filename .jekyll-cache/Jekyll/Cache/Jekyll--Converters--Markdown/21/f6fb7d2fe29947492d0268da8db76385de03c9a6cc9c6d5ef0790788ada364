<p>In this project, we‚Äôll create a digdag workflow that executes an embulk script for ingesting csv files to a MySQL database. We‚Äôll then write SQL queries to prepare and analyze the data.</p>

      <p><p>The vision for <code class="highlighter-rouge">Starsk√∏pe</code> : cyberoptic artificial telescope is to aggregate large datasets from multiple missions in order to give us a more accurate, more detailed picture of the stars and planets than what we have available to us in the limited view of a single picture from a single telescope at a single point in time.</p>

      <p><p>For the next phase of the Starsk√∏pe planet hunting project, I used <code class="highlighter-rouge">Google Colabs</code> to generate spectrograph images of the same star flux signals dataset from Kaggle. Due to memory constraints, I started out by only using a portion of this already small dataset as a test round. To save time, I ran the images through a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Keras Convolutional Network</code> using Theano, similar to the one I built in the first phase of the project. The results were not ideal, but this was to be expected.</p>

The top 5 zip code recommendations rely on the following factors: highest ROI, lowest confidence intervals, and shortest commute time from Grand Central Station. Along with several custom time series analysis helper functions I wrote for this project, I also extrapolate the USZIPCODE pypi library to account for several exogenous factors, including average income levels.</p>

      <p><p>Ask any realtor what are the top 3 most important variables for measuring property value, and they will all say the same thing: 1) location, 2) location, and 3) location.

      <p><p>It was the summer of 2019. I owned my own marketing and video production company, had my own apartment in Hollywood, friends that cared about me, and a girlfriend I loved. So why was I so miserable? Why was I waking up every day filled with dread, and staying awake at night, restless and consumed by anxiety? I hated the way I was living, but I was even more afraid of dying. ‚ÄúYet Another Existential Crisis‚Äù - I thought I knew who I was now, I thought I loved myself. Was all of it a lie?</p>
