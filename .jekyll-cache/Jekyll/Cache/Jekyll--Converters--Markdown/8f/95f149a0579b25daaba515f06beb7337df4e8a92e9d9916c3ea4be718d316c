I"ö<p>It was the summer of 2019. I owned my own marketing and video production company, had my own apartment in Hollywood, friends that cared about me, and a girlfriend I loved. So why was I so miserable? Why was I waking up every day filled with dread, and staying awake at night, restless and consumed by anxiety? I hated the way I was living, but I was even more afraid of dying. â€œYet Another Existential Crisisâ€ - I thought I knew who I was now, I thought I loved myself. Was all of it a lie?</p>
