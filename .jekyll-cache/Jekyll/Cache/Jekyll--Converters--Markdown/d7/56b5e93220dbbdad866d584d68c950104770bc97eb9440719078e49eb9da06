I"å<p>For the next phase of the Starsk√∏pe planet hunting project, I used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Google Colabs</code> to generate spectrograph images of the same star flux signals dataset from Kaggle. Due to memory constraints, I started out by only using a portion of this already small dataset as a test round. I ran the images through a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Keras 2D Convolutional Network</code> using Tensorflow, similar to the 1D CNN I built in the first phase of the project. The accuracy score was lower (0.86 vs .99), but this was to be expected due to the constraints of the dataset.</p>
