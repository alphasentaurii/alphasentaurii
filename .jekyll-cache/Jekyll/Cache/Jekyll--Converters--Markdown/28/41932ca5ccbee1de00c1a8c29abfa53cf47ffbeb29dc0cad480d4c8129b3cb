I"<p>It was the summer of 2019. I owned my own marketing and video production company, had my own apartment in Hollywood, friends that cared about me, and a girlfriend I loved. So why was I so miserable? Why was I waking up every day filled with dread, and staying awake at night, restless and consumed by anxiety? I hated the way I was living, but I was even more afraid of dying. ‚ÄúYet Another Existential Crisis‚Äù - I thought I knew who I was now, I thought I loved myself. Was all of it a lie?</p>

<h2 id="hope-vs-faith">Hope vs. Faith</h2>

<p>Any of us can look back at different points of our life and identify the breaking points. Moments of incredible fear, followed by moments of tremendous courage. To me, this is the difference between ‚ÄúHope‚Äù and ‚ÄúFaith‚Äù. Hope is static. It gets you through pain, but nothing changes if you don‚Äôt act. Faith is courageous action, carried by a belief in something greater than you. I had been hoping for so many things, but I didn‚Äôt even believe in myself.</p>

<h1 id="wild-imagination">Wild Imagination</h1>

<p>Peter Pan has always been one of my favorite childhood stories. I identify with not wanting to grow up because there‚Äôs nothing worse than being a grown-up with responsibilities and chores and low-level depression instigated by going to work every day for a job you hate. Like Peter, my wild imagination is one of my greatest assets. It helps me laugh at the absurdity and irony of life, because it‚Äôs easy to take ourselves too seriously and get bent out of shape about things that don‚Äôt really matter. Imagination is what gives us art, it‚Äôs why we have spaceships and a mission to Mars. We need to have our wild ideas that everyone thinks are impossible, and we need to have faith in what is infinite and unknown to our limited minds as mortal human beings. But Peter‚Äôs greatest asset is not that he believes in fairies and lives in a fantasy world of playtime ‚Äî it‚Äôs that he has tremendous courage. He is not afraid of death ‚Äî he welcomes it.</p>

<p>I thought to myself: why am I afraid of death? If I were to die young ‚Äî if I were to die tomorrow, what would I feel then? And the answer came to me immediately ‚Äî I would regret everything, I would feel like I had wasted so much time worrying about meeting other people‚Äôs expectations of me, and my life would feel meaningless. I‚Äôve known since I was a child what I love doing. My life flashed before my eyes, and I saw the seven-year-old version of Ru trying to solder the last piece of a little 3-wheeled robot I was trying to build. I saw myself collecting data in my field notebooks on the various species of mice, their habitats and diet. And another notebook for dinosaurs. I was obsessed with dinosaurs - never did find any out in the wild unfortunately.</p>

<h3 id="goofball-confused">Goofball Confused?</h3>

<p>I saw myself as an eight-year old laughing as each person in my family interacted with a Mac Basic program I had written on our Special Edition II. The user is prompted to type in their name and a couple of numbers to the input. Then, to everyone‚Äôs surprise, the program just calls them a Goofball plus whatever numbers they entered. The computer, and Goofball Confused? both still work by the way.</p>

<h3 id="closet-geek">‚ÄúCloset Geek‚Äù</h3>

<p>I saw myself at age nine building a spaceship out of legos and submitting it to an official contest (I didn‚Äôt win, but I framed the honorary certificate they sent because it meant that much to  me, and I was proud of my little rocket). I heard my fifth-grade science teacher asking me what I wanted to be when I grew up and the unhesitating reply from my ten-year-old lips: ‚ÄúASTRONAUT‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt see myself struggling to fit in for twenty years, but I saw my 32nd birthday when I successfully built a super-fast PC for 4K video production from the ground up. That moment when you  go to boot up and are silently praying you didn‚Äôt inadvertently short a circuit on the motherboard or put too much paste on the CPU when connecting the cooler.</p>

<h3 id="new-frequencies">New Frequencies</h3>

<p>I saw myself playing lead guitar and vocals to an audience of 200 kids when I was in eight grade, and live acoustic performances for my entire high schoool on an almost monthly basis. I didn‚Äôt think for a second about my twenties, where music, computers, spaceships and love for life became lost in my attempt to just make money and become someone important everyone would like. I saw myself getting an A in physics because it was my favorite class, but barely getting by in math because I didn‚Äôt think it would be useful to my writing and music career. I saw myself coming home from a long day at work and spending my free time doing homework and quizzes for the Intro to Aerospace Engineering class I signed up for online. I was just doing it for fun, but I ended up with a 97% final grade. Turns out I‚Äôm quite fond of math, especially if the equations have to do with calculating rocket trajectories.</p>

<h3 id="creation-and-pandemonium">Creation and Pandemonium</h3>

<p>None of us know when our time on earth is going to run out. I now see life is a precious gift - that to live is the only point of life, and that if we were ‚Äúcreated in God‚Äôs image‚Äù, then we should be creating, because that is how we bring Good into a world that would otherwise just be chaos. It‚Äôs been almost one year - the summer of Pandemic 2020. Last fall I quit my company, learned Python and multivariable calculus, and graduated from one of the top data science bootcamps in the world. What has always driven me, since childhood, is not data ‚Äì it‚Äôs patterns. I love code-breaking. I love solving mysteries, I love finding secret hidden meanings in words and numbers. That‚Äôs why I love music, computers, poetry and stories.</p>

<h3 id="artist---scientist---engineer">Artist - Scientist - Engineer</h3>

<p>What I realized last summer was that if I spend my days doing those simple things that make me who I already am, then I will wake up every day knowing why I exist, and I don‚Äôt need some grand meaning of life‚Äôs ultimate purpose to guide my destiny. I created this blog to remind myself of who I am and what I like to do. It gives me a purpose, it lets me share my passion with the world as I continue to explore myself as a Scientist, Artist and Engineer. A place to create, to experiment, and to build. If I do those three things every day, then I can leave the world in absolute peace knowing I lived exactly the way I was meant to live.</p>
