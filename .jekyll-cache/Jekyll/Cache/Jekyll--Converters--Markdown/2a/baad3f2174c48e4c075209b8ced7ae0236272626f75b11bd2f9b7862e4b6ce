I"≤<p>The vision for <code class="highlighter-rouge">Starsk√∏pe</code> : cyberoptic artificial telescope is to aggregate large datasets from multiple missions in order to give us a more accurate, more detailed picture of the stars and planets than what we have available to us in the limited view of a single picture from a single telescope at a single point in time.</p>

<h2 id="spectrograph-image-classification">Spectrograph Image Classification</h2>

<p>For the next phase of the Starsk√∏pe planet hunting project, I used <code class="highlighter-rouge">Google Colabs</code> to generate spectrograph images of the same star flux signals dataset from Kaggle. Due to memory constraints, I started out by only using a portion of this already small dataset as a test round. To save time, I ran the images through a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Keras Convolutional Network</code> using Theano, similar to the one I built in the first phase of the project. The results were not ideal, but this was to be expected.</p>

<h2 id="phase-3-scrape-mast-via-api-on-aws">Phase 3: Scrape MAST via API on AWS</h2>

<p>In order to improve model, therefore, the next step was to generate a larger dataset of images, using not only all the data from Kaggle, but also import additional signal datasets from the MAST API. Traditionally, this can be done from the MAST website directly. However, it is now possible to scrape the data for free from AWS where it is being (at least temporarily) housed.</p>
