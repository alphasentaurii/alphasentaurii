      <p><p>For the next phase of the Starsk√∏pe planet hunting project, I used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Google Colabs</code> to generate spectrograph images of the same star flux signals dataset from Kaggle. Due to memory constraints, I started out by only using a portion of this already small dataset as a test round. I ran the images through a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Keras 2D Convolutional Network</code> using Tensorflow, similar to the 1D CNN I built in the first phase of the project. The accuracy score was lower (0.86 vs .99), but this was to be expected due to the constraints of the dataset.</p>

  <p>‚ÄúMathematicians [‚Ä¶] are often led astray when ‚Äòstudying‚Äô physics because they lose sight of the physics. They say: <em>‚ÄòLook, these differential equations‚Äìthe Maxwell equations‚Äìare all there is to electrodynamics; it is admitted by the physicists that there is nothing which is not contained in the equations. The equations are complicated, but after all they are only mathematical equations and if I understand them mathematically inside out, I will understand the physics inside out.‚Äô</em> Only it doesn‚Äôt work that way. Mathematicians who study physics with that point of view‚Äìand there have been many of them‚Äìusually make little contribution to physics and, in fact, little to mathematics. They fail because the actual physical situations in the real world are so complicated that it is necessary to have a much broader understanding of the equations.‚Äù

      <p><p>It was the summer of 2019. I owned my own marketing and video production company, had my own apartment in Hollywood, friends that cared about me, and a girlfriend I loved. So why was I so miserable? Why was I waking up every day filled with dread, and staying awake at night, restless and consumed by anxiety? I hated the way I was living, but I was even more afraid of dying. ‚ÄúYet Another Existential Crisis‚Äù - I thought I knew who I was now, I thought I loved myself. Was all of it a lie?</p>
