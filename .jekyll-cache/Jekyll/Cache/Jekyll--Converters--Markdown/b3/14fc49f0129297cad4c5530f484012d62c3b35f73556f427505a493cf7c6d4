I"[<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Time Series Forecasting with SARIMAX and Gridsearch</code> is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">housing market prediction model</code> that uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">seasonal ARIMA time-series analysis and GridsearchCV</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">recommend the top 5 zip codes</code> for purchasing a single-family home in Westchester, New York. The top 5 zip code recommendations rely on the following factors: highest ROI, lowest confidence intervals, and shortest commute time from Grand Central Station. Along with several custom time series analysis helper functions I wrote for this project, I also extrapolate the USZIPCODE pypi library to account for several exogenous factors, including average income levels.</p>
