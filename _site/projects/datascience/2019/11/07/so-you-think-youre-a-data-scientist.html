<h1>So You Think You're a Data Scientist</h1>

<p class="view">by </p>

<p>If you had asked me four weeks ago to define ‘linear regression’ or how it can be useful for planning a business strategy or financial investment, I probably would have just stared at you blankly. I knew a little about statistics and I had a conceptual grasp of predictive analytics (I’ve worked in marketing for 10 years, c’mon) but I was very, very far away from being an expert in either arena.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or so I thought…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One short month ago marked the beginning of my journey toward becoming a professional data scientist. I had been teaching myself to code since I started designing websites (about 5 years ago), and I had taken a data analysis class with General Assembly to bolster my marketing / web analytics wheelhouse, but working in a technical career always seemed like some far off dream.</p>

<p>As a front-end web developer I quickly got bored with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">html</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">css</code> and started playing around with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">php</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">javascript</code>. Moving all my website clients over to AWS, it wasn’t long before I was configuring and managing linux/LAMP servers in my sleep. Learning the basics of database administration (mostly MySql) got me interested in the actual hardware and I wanted to know about everything that was going on under the hood. So for my 30th birthday, I <a href="/projects/pc-build.html">built my own supercomputer</a> from the ground up with parts I bought online.</p>

<p>However, while all this was going on, I was also the co-founder of a small marketing agency <a href="https://kinetik.la">kinetik</a> so I couldn’t dedicate as much time as I wanted to toward tech. I was getting burnt out on marketing…And life in general. At 32 years old, the only sure thing I knew about the world was that I didn’t like my life, I didn’t feel that connected to anyone, and plain and simple, I didn’t like how I spent my time during the day. I would often try to sleep as long as I could just to get through them. Other days I couldn’t sleep at all. I knew I wasn’t fulfilling my destiny, and whatever path(s) I had been following for the last three decades were not the right ones. I felt depressed and anxious almost all of the time.  I felt…lost.</p>

<p>There was no over night ‘aha!’ epiphany. It was like molasses getting poured out of a jar. Except this particular molasses is afraid to leave the jar because somewhere along the way of its miserable existence, it kind of just got used to being stuck in a place where it can’t breath or do or be anything but sh*tty old molasses; so the idea of suddenly being outside the jar is absolutely terrifying. However, I also ran out of money, several times, over and over again. So, at the behest of my investors (Mom and Dad), I basically had no choice but to hand everything over to my business partner and quit the company.</p>

<p>Giving up on Kinetik was one of the most difficult and painful decisions I have ever had to make in my life. Somehow giving up on your dream is much harder than struggling for two and a half years to keep it alive. But the dream was over, and it was time to wake up.</p>

<p>My interest in tech diverged in two directions - cybersecurity and data science. I began studying for the COMPTIA A+ exam thinking I could at least get a job fixing computers as my new beginning, and at the same time was taking an online course for Python. I fell in love with both experiences. Finally, I was ready to push the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reset</code> button on career, and on my entire life. So I pushed it. ‘No more Molasses!’</p>

<p>That’s when everything changed.</p>

<hr />

<p>I’m now 4 weeks in to a full-time data science bootcamp, and just completed my first big project. If you were to ask me today if I know anything about ‘linear regression’, I’d probably just show you instead of tell you. And that’s I’m going to do. Because today, unlike 4 weeks ago, I know how take over 25,000 data points subdivided into 18 different variables, and create a prediction model for increasing the property value of a house in the greater Seattle area. And I can say that whatever predictions are made using my model will carry 78% certainty in being correct.  I can tell you what the 3 most important variables are for house prices, and show you with pretty colored maps why I’m right. And that’s what this blog post is really supposed to be about. So let’s get going.</p>
