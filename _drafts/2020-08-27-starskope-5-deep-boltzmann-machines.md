__Spectrograph of Fourier-transform Flux Signal__

3. Explore using computer vision on not only the Full Frame images we can collect from telescopes like TESS, but also on spectographs of the flux values themselves. The beauty of machine learning is our ability to rely on the computer to pick up very small nuances in differences that we ourselves cannot see with our own eyes. 
   
4. Explore using autoencoded machine learning algorithms with Restricted Boltzmann Machines - this type of model has proven to be incredibly effective in the image analysis of handwriting as we've seen applied the MNIST dataset - let's find out if the same is true for images of stars, be they the Full Frame Images or spectographs.
