This tutorial will demonstrate statistical modeling techniques for time series analysis with machine learning data. Here is an outline of the steps we'll take:

1. Load time series data to perform ts indexing
2. Perform index based slicing to create subsets
3. Change the granularity of a time series
4. Data cleaning
5. Explore temporal structure with line plots
6. Understand/describe distribtion of observations using histograms and density plots.
7. Measure change in distribution over intervals using box+whisker plots and heatmap plots
