The spacekit.Computer class is for generating predictions and evaluating model metrics. The example here evaluates a neural network for classifying stars with orbiting exoplanets using time series signal analysis (light curves).

`spacekit` is a PyPi Machine Learning Utility Package for Astrophysical Data Science. This library is for performing signal analysis and machine learning on astrophysical datasets. 

## spacekit.Computer()

spacekit.Computer() includes the following class methods:
- get_preds: get predictions
- fnfp: count of false negatives and false positives
- keras_history: Keras history plots
- roc_plots: Receiver Operator Characteristic plots
- compute: evaluation metrics for model
