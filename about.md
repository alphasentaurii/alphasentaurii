**Hello, World.**

_My name is `Ru Ke√Øn`. Some words about me:_


Data Scientist and software developer focused on solving the most important technical challenges in science. My time on Earth is spent primarily on coding algorithms, building computers, composing music, and writing stories. As both artist and scientist, my favorite place to be is at the edge of uncertainty, navigating the unknown. Also, I just really love rockets, telescopes, robots, and computers.
